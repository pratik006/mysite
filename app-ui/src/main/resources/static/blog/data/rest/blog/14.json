This pristine forest, still largely unexplored, offers protection to more than 31 species of mammals, 250 species of birds, 276 species of insects, and, 38 species of other invertebrates. Many of these are Red Listed according to IUCN. It houses a diverse variety of floras, many of which are extremely rare.</span><div><h3 style=\"margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 16px; line-height: 1.43; font-size: 1.5em; position: relative; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif;\">Day 1:</h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;\">Take a night train from Sealdah Railway station to New Jalpaiguri(NJP).

On our way we had brunch at Geilkhola along the bank of river Teesta. Most of us enjoyed the freshly steamed Chicken Momos with chilly garlic local made sauce, which awakens my taste buds as I write ! One can enjoy the scenic beauty of river Teesta in Pista color. Locals say that this greenish tinge in the river reflects a clear weather in the mountains. After downpoures the water turns muddy as an aftereffect within 2 days.</span><div class=\"travelImg\" style=\"width: 500px; text-align: center; font-style: italic; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px !important;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wSnOIZjlsIv-G_C04ztlZWSBQbml47obyP5D-aFAQu4=w1192-h894-no\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">River Teesta at Geilkhola</div><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;\">We ascended to Rangpo along the river Teesta, from here the route turns east towards Rhenok along the Silk Route. we reached Aritar by 3:30 pm.

After having our lunch prepared their only we made it to our shelter and soon the weather cleared.

It is the land of the elegant red pandas and rich diverse flaura and fauna making these park an important wilderness zone. one must rfeturn to the base camp before dusk. On the way we collected firewood for the bonfire and witnessed the awe stucking sunset. As time was passing bonfire was the only way to keep us warm against the gradually droppinng temperature.
