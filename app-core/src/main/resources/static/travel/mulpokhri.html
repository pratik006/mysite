			<div style="width: 77%; float: left;">Mul Pokhari, other than being an amazing campsite and a birder’s paradise, also is a gateway to Neora
				Valley National Park, the last of the few remaining bio-diversities in our country and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This pristine forest, still
				largely unexplored, offers protection to more than 31 species of mammals, 250 species of birds, 276 species of insects, and, 38 species of other
				invertebrates. Many of these are Red Listed according to IUCN. It houses a diverse variety of floras, many of which are extremely rare.</div>

		We had booked a Swaraj Majda which took us to Aritar. On our way we had brunch at Geilkhola along the bank of river Teesta. Most of us enjoyed the
		freshly steamed Chicken Momos with chilly garlic local made sauce, which awakens my taste buds as I write ! One can enjoy the scenic beauty of river
		Teesta in Pista color. Locals say that this greenish tinge in the river reflects a clear weather in the mountains. After downpoures the water turns
		muddy as an aftereffect within 2 days.

		</div>
		We ascended to Rangpo along the river Teesta, from here the route turns east towards Rhenok along the Silk Route. we reached Aritar by 3:30 pm. Here
		we changed for Mulkharkha village, on mahindra comander jeeps through a bumpy and boulder filled roads for which it took us around 45 minutes to
		reach. One can enjoy the tranquility and serenity of this place with the sun setting in the western horizon creating a golden aura.

		We were welcomed by Mr. Neema Sherpa and his family with tea and pakoras, who shared two of his house as homestay. We were overwhelmed by their
		hospitality. One must catch the glimpse of sun set at dawn though keeping in mind to return to base before darkness sets in. One must not think that
		the night life is boring, on contrary it was amazing. They offered us locally fermented drinks,thumba and chang and kept us entertaining with some
		sentilating local dances and songs. being in a group we enjoyed a lot.

		our dinner was sumptuous filled with local delicacies consisting of nearby 12 items. All this they do much of to their happiness not as a means of
		livelihood.We were not at ease with the bone chilling weather except our captain-cum-coordinator,Nilanjanda for whom it was just another day at
		home. The homestay was a nice experience as the house provided was neat and clean with blankets and quilts. The washroom was common yet well
		maintained and with ample amount of water. Most of us had a sound sleep.



		<h3>Day 3:</h3>

		Witnessing the golden rays illuminating the peak of kanchenjunga was itself a memory.

		</div>

		We went to another point from where one can relish the raw beauty of kanchenjunga clearly. We had our breakfast and proceded for mulpokhari,the
		camping site for the day. At 10:00 am we started our trekking !, We were required to carry drinking water. On the way we witnessed many pictursque
		views and reached our destination mulpokhari, famous for the wishing lake, within 2 hours. We were unable to witness the reflection of kanchenjunga
		on the lake as it was covered with clouds but luckily we made it the next day. We pitched our tents for the first time with the initial instruction
		from our coordinator Nilanjan.

		As soon as we were finished with our tent pitching it started drizzling which later turned into snowfall. After having our lunch prepared their only
		we made it to our shelter and soon the weather cleared. After this we decided to experience and explore the wilderness of Neora Valley National
		Park,it is also known as birders' paradise,with our guide. It is the land of the elegant red pandas and rich diverse flaura and fauna making these
		park an important wilderness zone. one must rfeturn to the base camp before dusk. On the way we collected firewood for the bonfire and witnessed the
		awe stucking sunset. As time was passing bonfire was the only way to keep us warm against the gradually droppinng temperature. Camp lights, bonfire
		and torches were the only souce of light.

		Everybody were busy starring at the sky which was flooded with stars! and SHOOTING STARS ! We had dinner under the naked sky with the temperature
		continously falling and went for the long waited rest.

		<h3>Day 4:</h3>
		Ater the sleepless night because of extreme weather conditions we were eagerly waiting for the sunrise yet some where busy snooring. When we were
		unzipping the tent we realised that everything was frozen from tents to surroundings even ourselves.

			morning frost
		</div>

		Around 4:30 we witnessed the shimmering beauty of the sky flooded with stars and moon! then we approached to Mulpokhri Wishing Lake to witness the
		mesmirizing golden rays falling on the "Khangchendzonga Peak". The gradual change in the color of the mighty Khangchendzonga from white to orange to
		white was indeed worth watching. Then we packed our luggages including our tents and started descending to Mulkharkha village. By this time the
		frost started melting making the mountain slopes very slippery. But luckily it dried off very soon. We reached Mulkharkha Village and were served
		with the breakfast.

			return journey at Mulkharkha
		</div>

		The host bid us farewell wholeheartedly in a very tradiotional way by giving scarf and thanking us for being their guest. Though one can reach
		Aritar by a jeep,which is needed to be booked earlier by informing the host, we trekked down keeping the bag and buggages inside the jeep. We then
		boarded a bus, which was booked in advance, had lunch at Rangpo and reached NGP at 7:45 pm. We then boarded PADATIK EXPRESS which was scheduled to
		depart at 9:00 pm and had our dinner which came to us as a surprise by our captain, Nilanjan da while we were busy calling out all the memories.

		<h3>Day 5</h3>
		We reached Sealdah by 7:20 am with new relations, new bondings and new memories of the mesmirizing Mulphokri !
